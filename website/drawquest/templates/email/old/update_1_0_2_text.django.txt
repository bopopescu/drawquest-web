Dear {{ notification.recipient.username }},

We're excited to announce our very first DrawQuest update just went live in the App Store. To update, open App Store on your iPad and tap Updates.

This update is all about making sure you have a great experience using DrawQuest. Here's what's in it:

✓ Never lose your drawings! If the app closes, your progress will be recovered.
✓ Major stability improvements. Seeya crashes!
✓ Fixed errors with publishing to Facebook.
✓ Lots of miscellaneous bug fixes and polish.

We're hard at work on our next update, which will include a number of additional features, including the ability to view all drawings for a given quest gallery, and a better way of discovering popular drawings and other DrawQuest users. We're incorporating a lot of your feedback and suggestions, so if you haven't already, please feel free to send us your thoughts at feedback@example.com.

Finally, if you're enjoying the newly updated app, please take a moment to rate it in the App Store. And if you have any questions or ideas for us, just reply to this email!
