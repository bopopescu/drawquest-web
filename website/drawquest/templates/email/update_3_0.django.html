        As you’ll see, we reimagined DrawQuest from the ground up for iOS 7. We hope you
        love the new look as much as we do!

        Under the hood, there are a bunch of new features and improvements. Here are some
        of the highlights:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Create your own Quest</strong>. Feeling inspired? Now you can
                create and share
                your own Quests. Start Quests for fan art, family hangouts, drawing
                games—anything. Your followers will receive drawing challenges that you
                create in DrawQuest. We’re can't wait to see how you make use of this
                creative platform. You can create Quests on iPhone and iPod touch today,
                and it's coming soon to iPad!

            <p>
                <strong>An entirely new editor</strong>. We’ve made big under-the-hood
                improvements to the Editor, and we're pleased to deliver one of the most
                requested features: a zoomable canvas, so you can get really fine detail
                in your drawings.
            </p>
        </li>

            <p>
                <strong>Introducing Patty the Paint Can</strong>. Meet the newest member
                of the tool family! Patty fills up the whole canvas, making it a cinch to
                color the background.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If it’s been a while since your last Quest, now's a great time to come back
        to the DrawQuest community. Download the latest version on your iPad, iPhone,
        or iPod touch, and let us know what you think!
