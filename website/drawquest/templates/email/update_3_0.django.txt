As you’ll see, we reimagined DrawQuest from the ground up for iOS 7. We hope you love the new look as much as we do!

Under the hood, there are a bunch of new features and improvements. Here are some of the highlights:

Create your own Quest. Feeling inspired? Now you can create and share your own Quests. Start Quests for fan art, family hangouts, drawing games—anything. Your followers will receive drawing challenges that you create in DrawQuest. We’re can't wait to see how you make use of this creative platform. You can create Quests on iPhone and iPod touch today, and it's coming soon to iPad!

An entirely new editor. We’ve made big under-the-hood improvements to the Editor, and we're pleased to deliver one of the most requested features: a zoomable canvas, so you can get really fine detail in your drawings. 

Introducing Patty the Paint Can. Meet the newest member of the tool family! Patty fills up the whole canvas, making it a cinch to color the background.

If it’s been a while since your last Quest, now is a great time to come back to the DrawQuest community. Download the latest version on your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch, and let us know what you think!

Happy Questing!
—The DrawQuest Team
