"        <p class=\"about_us\">\n"
"            <strong>Why we built DrawQuest</strong>\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            Deep down, we're all creative people. Unfortunately, as Sir Ken "
"Robinson <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/"
"ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html\" target=\"_blank\">warns us</"
"a>, society is \"educating people out of their creativity.\" In school, "
"we're led to believe that creative pursuits won't lead to a job, while "
"subjects like math and science will. So as we grow up, we grow out of our "
"creative habits.\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            It doesn't have to be this way. We built DrawQuest to bring "
"creative expression back into your daily life.\n"
"        </p>\n"
"        <p class=\"about_us\">\n"
"            <strong>But I'm not creative!</strong>\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            Creativity isn't a mystical gift passed on to some people and "
"not others. Creativity is like brushing your teeth &mdash; it's a healthy "
"habit you should make time for every day.\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            DrawQuest isn't about \"winning\" or becoming the next Picasso. "
"DrawQuest is about re-learning to express yourself creatively and sticking "
"with it. Everything about DrawQuest &mdash; from our simple drawing tools to "
"the ability to star and play back drawings &mdash; was designed to foster a "
"community of budding creators.\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            What are you waiting for? <a href=\"/download\" target=\"_blank"
"\">Download</a> the app and come create with us!\n"
"        </p>\n"
"    "
msgstr "\n"
"        <h1>我們的使命</h1>\n"
"        <p class=\"about_us\">\n"
"            <strong>為何開發DrawQuest</strong>\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            在每個人內心深處，我們都是有創意的人。不幸的是，就像肯•羅賓遜先生<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/"
"ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html\" target=\"_blank\">警告我們</"
"a>的一樣，社會會“讓人們失去創造性\"。在學校，我們被迫認為追求創造性會找不到工作，而學好數學和科學能找到好工作。所以，隨著我們慢慢長大，我們漸漸失去了創造的習慣。\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            其實我們大可不必如此成長。我們打造了DrawQuest就是為了讓創造重新回歸你的日常生活。\n"
"        </p>\n"
"        <p class=\"about_us\">\n"
"            <strong>但是我缺乏創造性!</strong>\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            創造性並不是某些人獨有而他人沒有的神秘禮物。創造性就像刷牙一樣&mdash;它是一個每天都應該堅持的習慣。\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            DrawQuest不是關於\"獲勝\"或成為下一個畢卡索。DrawQuest是關於重新學習創造性地表達自我並持之以恆。從簡單的繪畫工具到讚和播放繪畫功能，DrawQuest提供的一切都是為了培養一個萌芽中的創造者社區。\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            你還在等什麼呢? <a href=\"/download\" target=\"_blank"
