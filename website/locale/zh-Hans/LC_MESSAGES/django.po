"        <p class=\"about_us\">\n"
"            <strong>Why we built DrawQuest</strong>\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            Deep down, we're all creative people. Unfortunately, as Sir Ken "
"Robinson <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/"
"ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html\" target=\"_blank\">warns us</"
"a>, society is \"educating people out of their creativity.\" In school, "
"we're led to believe that creative pursuits won't lead to a job, while "
"subjects like math and science will. So as we grow up, we grow out of our "
"creative habits.\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            It doesn't have to be this way. We built DrawQuest to bring "
"creative expression back into your daily life.\n"
"        </p>\n"
"        <p class=\"about_us\">\n"
"            <strong>But I'm not creative!</strong>\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            Creativity isn't a mystical gift passed on to some people and "
"not others. Creativity is like brushing your teeth &mdash; it's a healthy "
"habit you should make time for every day.\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            DrawQuest isn't about \"winning\" or becoming the next Picasso. "
"DrawQuest is about re-learning to express yourself creatively and sticking "
"with it. Everything about DrawQuest &mdash; from our simple drawing tools to "
"the ability to star and play back drawings &mdash; was designed to foster a "
"community of budding creators.\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            What are you waiting for? <a href=\"/download\" target=\"_blank"
"\">Download</a> the app and come create with us!\n"
"        </p>\n"
"    "
msgstr "\n"
"        <h1>我们的使命</h1>\n"
"        <p class=\"about_us\">\n"
"            <strong>为何开发DrawQuest</strong>\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            在每个人内心深处，我们都是有创意的人。不幸的是，就像肯•罗宾逊先生<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/"
"ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html\" target=\"_blank\">警告我们</"
"a>的一样，社会会“让人们失去创造性\"。在学校，我们被迫认为追求创造性会找不到工作，而学好数学和科学能找到好工作。所以，随着我们慢慢长大，我们渐渐失去了创造的习惯。\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            其实我们大可不必如此成长。我们打造了DrawQuest就是为了让创造重新回归你的日常生活。\n"
"        </p>\n"
"        <p class=\"about_us\">\n"
"            <strong>但是我缺少创造性!</strong>\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            创造性并不是某些人独有而他人没有的神秘礼物。创造性就像刷牙一样&mdash;它是一个每天都应该坚持的习惯。\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
"            DrawQuest不是关于\"获胜\"或成为下一个毕加索。DrawQuest是关于重新学习创造性地表达自我并持之以恒。从简单的绘画工具到赞和播放绘画功能，DrawQuest提供的一切都是为了培养一个萌芽中的创造者社区。\n"
"            <br><br>\n"
